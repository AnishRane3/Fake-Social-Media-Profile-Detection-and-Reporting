# Fake Social Media Profile Detection and Reporting

Using a Kaggle dataset, we focused on Instagram, employing RandomForestClassifier in Python's scikit-learn library for accurate profile detection. 
Rather than directly labeling profiles, the model provides probabilities of fake and real profiles, contributing to nuanced decision-making.
